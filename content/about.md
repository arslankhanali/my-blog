# About

Welcome to my blog — a space where I share practical insights, deployment patterns, and lessons from real-world IT architecture and automation projects.

Here, you'll find:

- 🔧 **Tech Walkthroughs** — Open source tooling, secure deployment patterns, and container-native workflows using Podman and Linux-based infrastructure.  
- 🌐 **Home Lab & Automation** — Hands-on experiments with Home Assistant, HomeKit, Fedora servers, and self-hosted services.
- 🛡️ **Security & Best Practices** — Focus security, supply chain integrity, and observability.
- 📦 **Modern Ops** — GitOps, CI/CD with GitLab & ArgoCD, Helm templating, and cloud-native design thinking.

Whether you’re an engineer, architect, or open source enthusiast — I hope this blog helps you build smarter and more secure systems.
